Notes:

I ran into a lot of different ways to add the for loops and games reset/ wins/ losses/ key events.
I played with different ways on how I wanted to do it and ended up with what I felt was a frankenstein 
code but I coudln't get some aspects to work like I wanted it to. I found that this. method is very confusing
and gave me a lot of issues when starting but ultimately I used it becuase I looked up ways to have open 
configuration of code that I could change later. Even though I could do that anyways I felt this. method
was a great way for me to do this. I did it but didn't quite understand it until today. I read about it
but used it in the way that was being used as an example on a webpage but ended up understanding theres
a flaw in using this. since its anonymous but it worked me for what I needed it to. 

I also wanted to change the for loops to for each but didn't get to it.
